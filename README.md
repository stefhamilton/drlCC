Much of the below documentation is from Udacitiy's https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/blob/master/p2_continuous-control/README.md. The code is also based on Udacity's https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/ddpg-pendulum.

### Project Details
In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

A unity environment was used where there were 20 identical agents. The environment is considered solved when the agents get an average score of +30 (over 100 consecutive episodes, and over all agents). 

### Getting Started

3. Place it in the root folder.
4. Open train_model.py and update line 13 to point to your unity environment

### Intructions
To train an agent run 'python train_mdoel.py'
